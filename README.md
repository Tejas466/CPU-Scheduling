Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

This project is a web-based simulation tool for various CPU scheduling algorithms. It supports multiple scheduling algorithms such as First-Come First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin Scheduling (RRS), Longest Job First (LJF), Priority Scheduling, Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF), and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). The simulator allows users to input processes with arrival times, burst times, and optionally priorities and quantum times depending on the algorithm chosen.

Features
Add Multiple Processes: Users can dynamically add processes with different parameters such as arrival time, burst time, and priority.
Algorithm Selection: Supports multiple scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, LJF, Priority Scheduling, LRTF, and SRTF.
Gantt Chart and Progress Bars: Visual representation of process execution with real-time progress bars for each process.
Results Table: Displays results of the scheduling such as start time, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process.
Dynamic Quantum & Priority Input: Automatically adjusts the input fields based on the selected algorithm (e.g., quantum time for Round Robin and priority for Priority Scheduling).

Algorithms Supported
1. First-Come First-Serve (FCFS): Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
2. Shortest Job First (SJF): Processes with the shortest burst time are executed first.
3. Round Robin Scheduling (RRS): Processes are executed in a cyclic manner, using a time quantum for each.
4. Longest Job First (LJF): Processes with the longest burst time are executed first.
5. Priority Scheduling: Processes with the highest priority are executed first.
6. Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF): Processes with the longest remaining burst time are executed first.
7. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF): Processes with the shortest remaining burst time are executed first.
